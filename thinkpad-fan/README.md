# Noctalia Fan & Thermal Control Plugin (`thinkpad-fan`)

A resilient system utility plugin designed for the **Noctalia** desktop shell environment. It monitors embedded system temperatures and maps hardware overrides to manual fan speeds directly through secure sysfs platform pathways without escalation prompts.

## Features
--------

*   **Dynamic Fan Speed Indicator**: Embedded status bar module reporting realtime revolutions per minute (`RPM`) telemetry, updating cycles safely every 2 seconds.
*   **Thermal Zone Inspector**: Contextual diagnostic popup panel tracking active primary sensor clusters.
*   **Stateful Micro-Pill Alerts**: Custom visual states that color-shift dynamically based on active overrides:
    *   Turns **Solid Crimson Red** if safety limits are bypassed by forcing the fans off (`level 0`).
    *   Shifts to system `mTertiary` palette states when explicit constant numeric thresholds are locked down.

## Prerequisites
-------------

1.  **ACPI Drivers**: Ensure driver hooks are mapped correctly (e.g., `thinkpad_acpi` loaded with control permission flags allowed: `options thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1`).
2.  **Udev Mapping Rules**: Write permissions are required to execute adjustments inside `/proc/acpi/ibm/fan` without utilizing full root escalation pipelines.

## Installation and Setup
----------------------

### 1\. Run Local Security Mapping Adjustments

Grant group write parameters over systemic thermal interfaces by applying the setup script:

    cd ~/.config/noctalia/plugins/fan-speed/
    chmod +x setup_permissions.sh
    ./setup_permissions.sh

### 2\. Session Reset

Log out of your graphical target environment session completely to ensure the hardware communication group attachments lock successfully into place before restarting your window manager layout.
